CHANGELOG:

v1.0 - First Major Release
  - Updated network API to match the new standard; this also requires the
    latest network version.  (Recent versions of network crashed some functions
    when backend modification of network objects was attempted.)

v0.5 - Internal Release
  - Added a new approximation method to rnspatial.grid, allowing the use of
    a constant probability approximation where the probability surface is
    sufficiently smooth.  This should greatly improve performance on densely
    populated landscapes for which simple exclusion of cells with low
    interaction probability is insufficient.
  - Made a simple change to rnspatial.grid to speed computation on very
    sparsely populated surfaces (with many empty grid entries).

v0.4 - Internal Release
  - Changed the way that tieVolume creates sparse matrices; apparently,
    elementwise addition is so amazingly slow that it was dramatically
    impairing performance.  A fast method is now employed (as well as an
    amusing R implementation of a stack -- not something that R does well,
    but there is a way...).
  - Fixed an obscure bug in rspop involving spatialPolygons.

v0.3 - Internal Release
  - Added rnspatial.rtree, moved old rnspatial to rnspatial.grid.  Method 
    control is now governed by a generic shell routine (called rnspatial).
    Note that this will break code that called rnspatial using positional
    parameters for the "model" argument, since this has been right-shifted.
    Otherwise, everything should work (and the grid method is still the 
    default, at least for the time being).
  - Added C-level minimum distance code for rectilinear bounding boxes under
    Minkowski metrics.

v0.2 - Internal Release
  - Started actually keeping track of releases.
  - Added new sna edgelist output option to rnspatial.  This saves on overhead
    for very large, sparse graphs (especially when they will be sent to sna
    routines for analysis, anyway).
  - Made some internal tweaks that might solve an alleged memory corruption
    problem within tieVolume.rtree for large matrices.  These are not true
    bug fixes (more "conservative code changes"), and thus may or may not
    have any effect.

v0.1 - Initial Internal Release
